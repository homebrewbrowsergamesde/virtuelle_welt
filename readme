    Installation Instructions
    #########################

  - Modify $/ftp/data/database_connect.inc.php and $/src/data/database.sql.
  - Execute $/src/data/database.sql on your MySQL server.
  - Copy contents of $/ftp/ into the root directory of your Welt web
    project including all hidden .htaccess files.
  - Ensure that the directory $/cache/ is writable on your Welt web
    project.
  - The directory $/editor/ on your Welt web project is inaccessible via
    .htaccess by default, you may rename it and replace the access protection
    with a proper .htaccess and .htpasswd setting. Using the editor always
    affects the live system, so you may not upload it into your Welt web
    project but use it only locally.
